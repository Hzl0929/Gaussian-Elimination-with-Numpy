# Gaussian-Elimination-with-Numpy
Just for Linear Algebra and Numpy practice.

In order to perform Gaussian Elimination algorithm:

Imoprt nesscery modules or defined all auxiliary function (optional).

Turn the input matrix to Row echelon from.

Perform Back sbustitution process.

At last, combine all defined functions to Gaussian_Elimination function and get the result.

Highly recommended run with JupyterNotebook.
