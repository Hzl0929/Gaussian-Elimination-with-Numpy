# Gaussian-Elimination-with-Numpy
Just for Linear Algebra and Numpy practice.

**In order to perform Gaussian Elimination algorithm:**

1.Imoprt nesscery modules or defined all auxiliary function (optional).

2.Turn the input matrix to Row echelon from.

3.Perform Back sbustitution process.

4.At last, combine all defined functions to Gaussian_Elimination function and get the result.

*Highly recommended run with JupyterNotebook.*
